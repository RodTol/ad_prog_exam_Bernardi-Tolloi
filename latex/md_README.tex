\# \doxysection*{Brief Description\+:}

In this readme file, we describe briefly the structure of the repository, its files, how to compile them and run them.

\doxysubsection*{-\/ main.\+cpp}

\href{./main.cpp}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This file contains a series of tests to check that the binary search tree class ({\ttfamily bst}) works properly. The following tree was implemented as an example.\textbackslash{} \textbackslash{} 

\doxysubsection*{-\/ benchmark-\/bst.\+cpp}

\href{./benchmark-bst.cpp}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This file contain a simple benchmark of the find function of the {\ttfamily bst} class, against the equivalent function of {\ttfamily std\+::map}.

\doxysubsection*{-\/ makefile}

\href{./Makefile}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This file is used to compile in the right way both benchmark-\/bst.\+cpp and main.\+cpp. If run with \char`\"{}make documentation\char`\"{}, it will generate the Doxygen documentation.

\doxysection*{Folder\+: Include}

\doxysubsection*{-\/ \mbox{\hyperlink{node_8hpp_source}{node.\+hpp}}}

\href{./include/node.hpp}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This file creates a struct {\ttfamily node} with some base function and operators. \doxysubsection*{-\/ \mbox{\hyperlink{iterator_8hpp_source}{iterator.\+hpp}}}

\href{./include/iterator.hpp}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This file creates a struct {\ttfamily iterator} with some base function and operators. In particular the pre-\/increment operator {\ttfamily ++}. \doxysubsection*{-\/ \mbox{\hyperlink{bst_8hpp_source}{bst.\+hpp}}}

\href{./include/bst.hpp}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This file creates a class {\ttfamily bst} with some function and operators.

\doxysection*{Folder\+: Doxygen}

\doxysubsection*{-\/ doxy.\+in}

\href{./Doxygen/doxy.in}{\texttt{ link to file}}\textbackslash{} This is the Doxygen configuration file.

\# \doxysection*{Compilation\+:}

To compile in the correct way the files, the user just needs to run the command \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} in the terminal. To obtain also the Doxygen documentation, the user must use \char`\"{}make documentation\char`\"{}.

\# \doxysection*{Execution\+:}

To run the {\itshape main} program, the user must use the command \char`\"{}./main.\+x\char`\"{}. Similarly for {\itshape benchmark-\/bst}, the command is \char`\"{}./benchmark-\/bst\char`\"{}. This program will ask the user for the size of the random tree on which the benchmark will be performed.

\# \doxysection*{Report\+:}

Inside \char`\"{}report.\+pdf\char`\"{} \href{./report.pdf}{\texttt{ link to file}} is contained a short report about the code.
